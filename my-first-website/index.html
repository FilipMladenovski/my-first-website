                    <h2>Mobile Phone</h2>
                    <p>A mobile phone (or cellphone[a]) is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a
                        radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area, as opposed to a
                        fixed-location phone (landline phone). The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the
                        switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched
                        telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture
                        and therefore mobile telephones are called cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America. In
                        addition to telephony, digital mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text
                        messaging, multimedia messagIng, email, Internet access (via LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi), short-range
                        wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), satellite access (navigation, messaging
                        connectivity), business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones
                        offering only basic capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly
                        advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.<a href="#">Click here to

                    <h2>Tablet</h2>
                    <p>A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile
                        operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a
                        single, thin and flat package. Tablets, being computers, have similar capabilities, but lack
                        some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern
                        smartphones,<span class="bolded"> the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger
                            than smartphones</span>,
                        with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally,[1][2][3][4] and may not support
                        access to a cellular network. Unlike laptops (which have traditionally run off operating systems
                        usually designed for desktops), tablets usually run mobile operating systems, alongside
                        smartphones.</p>

                <h2>Internet and TV</h2>
                <p><span class="italic">Up until the 1990s</span>, it was not thought possible that a television show
                    could be squeezed into the
                    limited telecommunication bandwidth of a copper telephone cable to provide a streaming service of
                    acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a digital television signal was around 200 Mbit/s,
                    which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper telephone wire.[1]

                    Streaming services started as a result of two major technological developments: MPEG
                    (motion-compensated DCT) video compression and asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) data
                    communication.</p>

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user
                    interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to
                    generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a
                    television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a
                    virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered
                    through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g.,
                    haptic technology that provides tactile sensations), and some video games also allow microphone and
                    webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.

                    Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally
                    includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN
                    games, online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto
                    mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and
                    augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide
                    range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.</p>
